FISHING REGULATIONS DISPLAY

In the this repo, you will find a file called fishingRegulations.js with data regarding fishing regulations.
Your task is to write code to display this data in a user-friendly format.

You can use a table, a list, cards, or whatever format you wish.
If using a table or list, it is useful to provide visual assistance to recognize data
belonging to the same record/row across the screen by shading the background of every other row.

You must use Typescript and React.

Use these guidelines for display:

Null nickname or no records should be displayed as "none"

Multiple nicknames should be displayed with commas between them in one field

No start or end date should be displayed as "Open Season"

If there is neither a minimum or maximum size should be displayed as "No size limit"

Sizes should be displayed in inches with labels for minimum, maximum or slot (for both min and max)

Minimum and maximum size should be combined into one field

Null bag limit should be displayed as "No bag limit"
